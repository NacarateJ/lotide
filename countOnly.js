// implement a function called countOnly. It take in a collection of items and return counts
// for a specific subset of those items. It won't count everything. In order to decide what to count,
// it will also be given an idea of which items we care about and it will only count those, ignoring the others.

// countOnly will be given an array and an object. It will return an object containing counts of
// everything that the input object listed.

// Ex:
// arr = [a, a, b, c, d, e, a]

// object = {
// a: true,
// d: true,
// b: false,
// f:true
// }

// expected result = {
// a:3,
// d:1
// }

// only keys which have a truthy value should be counted in the resulting object.
// All other strings (either set to false or not included at all in the object) should not be counted.
// That said, if a particular string is meant to be counted but does not exist in the input
// array (like "f" in the example above), it also does not have to be included in the final count.
